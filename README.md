# 1RT745 Reinforcement Learning
Repo for the course 1RT745 Reinforcement Learning

## Course content
The course provides an introduction to the field of reinforcement learning. 

The course covers:
- Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
- Dynamic programming to solve MDPs where the transition probabilities are known.
- Model free RL methods where the transition probabilities are not known and they have to be learnt from data:
  - Monte Carlo method
  - TD-learning
  - SARSA
  - Q-learning
- Model-based methods:

## Course structure
Alongside lectures the tinkering notebooks, found in the folder Tinkering Notebooks, provide hands-on experience with the implementations of the course content.
